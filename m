I'm saying that supporting the official language spec makes more sense 
than attempting to support a multitude of divergent interpretations of the 
spec (i.e. gcc, clang, coverity etc.)

I'm also saying that the reason why we use -std=gnu89 is that existing 
code was written in that language, not in ad hoc languages comprised of 
collections of extensions that change with every release.

Thank you for checking. I found a free version that's only 6 weeks old:

It will be interesting to see whether 6.7.11.5 changes once the various 
implementations reach agreement.
