So looks like the bulk of these are:
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    ++x;
  default:
    break;
}

I have a patch that fixes those up for clang:
https://reviews.llvm.org/D91895

There's 3 other cases that don't quite match between GCC and Clang I
observe in the kernel:
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    ++x;
  default:
    goto y;
}
y:;

switch (x) {
  case 0:
    ++x;
  default:
    return;
}

switch (x) {
  case 0:
    ++x;
  default:
    ;
}

Based on your link, and Nathan's comment on my patch, maybe Clang
should continue to warn for the above (at least the `default: return;`
case) and GCC should change?  While the last case looks harmless,
there were only 1 or 2 across the tree in my limited configuration
testing; I really think we should just add `break`s for those.
