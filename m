"future mistakes that it might prevent" is neither pessimism nor states a fac=
t.

It is only knee-jerk if you think you are infallible.

This warning comes from a development tool -- the compiler.

The kernel is not a frozen codebase.

Further, "mature code vs. risk of change" arguments don't apply here
because the semantics of the program and binary output isn't changing.

Again: adding a `fallthrough` does not change the program semantics.
If you are a maintainer and want to cross-check, compare the codegen.

Yeah: negative. On the other hand, the overall cost of the countless
-fI-am-infallible flags is very noticeable.

If you really believe compiler warnings and static analysis are
useless and costly, I think there is not much point in continuing the
discussion.

I was not asking you to prove it. I am stating that proving it is very easy.
