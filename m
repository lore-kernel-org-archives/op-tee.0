No, I have not said that. Please don't put words in my mouth (again).

I have said *authoring* lines of *this* kind takes a minute per line.
Specifically: lines fixing the fallthrough warning mechanically and
repeatedly where the compiler tells you to, and doing so full-time for
a month.

For instance, take the following one from Gustavo. Are you really
saying it takes 12 minutes (your number) to write that `break;`?

I have not said that either. I said reviewing and merging those are
noise compared to any complex patch. Testing should be done by the
author comparing codegen.

It is useful since it makes intent clear. It also catches actual bugs,
which is even more valuable.

First of all, voluntary maintainers choose their own workload.
Furthermore, we already measure capacity in the `MAINTAINERS` file:
maintainers can state they can only handle a few patches. Finally, if
someone does not have time for a trivial patch, they are very unlikely
to have any time to review big ones.

Again, I have not said anything of the sort.
