Main updates from version V15[1]:
- Removed the rproc_ops:load_fw() operation introduced in the previous versio=
n.
- Returned to managing the remoteproc firmware loading in rproc_tee_parse_fw =
to
  load and authenticate the firmware before getting the resource table.
- Added spinlock and dev_link mechanisms in remoteproc TEE to better manage
  bind/unbind.

More details are available in each patch commit message.

Tested-on: commit 0a0ba9924445 ("Linux 6.14-rc7")

Description of the feature:
--------------------------
This series proposes the implementation of a remoteproc tee driver to
communicate with a TEE trusted application responsible for authenticating
and loading the remoteproc firmware image in an Arm secure context.

1) Principle:

The remoteproc tee driver provides services to communicate with the OP-TEE
trusted application running on the Trusted Execution Context (TEE).
The trusted application in TEE manages the remote processor lifecycle:

- authenticating and loading firmware images,
- isolating and securing the remote processor memories,
- supporting multi-firmware (e.g., TF-M + Zephyr on a Cortex-M33),
- managing the start and stop of the firmware by the TEE.

2) Format of the signed image:

Refer to:
https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/ta/remoteproc/src/remoteproc_c=
ore.c#L18-L57

3) OP-TEE trusted application API:

Refer to:
https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/ta/remoteproc/include/ta_remot=
eproc.h

4) OP-TEE signature script

Refer to:
https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/scripts/sign_rproc_fw.py

Example of usage:
sign_rproc_fw.py --in <fw1.elf> --in <fw2.elf> --out <signed_fw.sign> --key $=
{OP-TEE_PATH}/keys/default.pem


5) Impact on User space Application

No sysfs impact. The user only needs to provide the signed firmware image
instead of the ELF image.


For more information about the implementation, a presentation is available he=
re
(note that the format of the signed image has evolved between the presentation
and the integration in OP-TEE).
