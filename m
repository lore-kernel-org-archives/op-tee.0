+OP-TEE notifications
+--------------------
+
+There are two kinds of notifications that secure world can use to make
+normal world aware of some event.
+
+1. Synchronous notifications delivered with ``OPTEE_RPC_CMD_NOTIFICATION``
+   using the ``OPTEE_RPC_NOTIFICATION_SEND`` parameter.
+2. Asynchronous notifications delivered with a combination of a non-secure
+   edge-triggered interrupt and a fast call from the non-secure interrupt
+   handler.
+
+Synchronous notifications are limited by depending on RPC for delivery,
+this is only usable when secure world is entered with a yielding call via
+``OPTEE_SMC_CALL_WITH_ARG``. This excludes such notifications from secure
+world interrupt handlers.
+
+An asynchronous notification is delivered via a non-secure edge-triggered
+interrupt to an interrupt handler registered in the OP-TEE driver. The
+actual notification value are retrieved with the fast call
+``OPTEE_SMC_GET_ASYNC_NOTIF_VALUE``. Note that one interrupt can represent
+multiple notifications.
+
+One notification value ``OPTEE_SMC_ASYNC_NOTIF_VALUE_DO_BOTTOM_HALF`` has a
+special meaning. When this value is received it means that normal world is
+supposed to make a yielding call ``OPTEE_MSG_CMD_DO_BOTTOM_HALF``. This
+call is done from the thread assisting the interrupt handler. This is a
+building block for OP-TEE OS in secure world to implement the top half and
+bottom half style of device drivers.
