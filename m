What I meant was that you've used pessimism as if it was fact.

For example, "There is no way to guess what the effect would be if the 
compiler trained programmers to add a knee-jerk 'break' statement to avoid 
a warning".

Moreover, what I meant was that preventing programmer mistakes is a 
problem to be solved by development tools. The idea that retro-fitting new 
language constructs onto mature code is somehow necessary to "prevent 
future mistakes" is entirely questionable.

Perhaps "handwaving" is a better term?

Sure. And if you put -Wimplicit-fallthrough into the Makefile and if that 
leads to well-intentioned patches that cause regressions, it is partly on 
you.

Have you ever considered the overall cost of the countless 
-Wpresume-incompetence flags?

Perhaps you pay the power bill for a build farm that produces logs that 
no-one reads? Perhaps you've run git bisect, knowing that the compiler 
messages are not interesting? Or compiled software in using a language 
that generates impenetrable messages? If so, here's a tip:

# grep CFLAGS /etc/portage/make.conf 
CFLAGS="... -Wno-all -Wno-extra ..."
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

Now allow me some pessimism: the hardware upgrades, gigawatt hours and 
wait time attributable to obligatory static analyses are a net loss.

No, it's not for me to prove that such patches don't affect code 
generation. That's for the patch author and (unfortunately) for reviewers.
