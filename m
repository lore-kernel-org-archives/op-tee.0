Add support for TEE based trusted keys where TEE provides the functionality
to seal and unseal trusted keys using hardware unique key. Also, this is
an alternative in case platform doesn't possess a TPM device.

This patch-set has been tested with OP-TEE based early TA which is already
merged in upstream [1].
