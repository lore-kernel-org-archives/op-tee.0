There are many implementations, so I think you are guaranteed to find more 
divergence if you look. That's because the spec is full of language like 
this: "implementations are encouraged not to emit a diagnostic" and 
"implementations are encouraged to issue a diagnostic".

Some implementations will decide to not emit (under the premise that vast 
amounts of existing code would have to get patched until the compiler goes 
quiet) whereas other implementations will decide to emit (under the 
premise that the author is doing the checking and not the janitor or the 
packager).

If that claim were true, the solution would be simple. (It's not.)

For the benefit of projects that enable -Werror and projects that 
nominated gcc as their preferred compiler, clang would simply need a flag 
to enable conformance with gcc by suppressing those additional warnings 
that clang would normally produce.

This simple solution is, of course, completely unworkable, since it would 
force clang to copy some portion of gcc's logic (rewritten under LLVM's 
unique license) and then to track future changes to that portion of gcc 
indefinitely.
