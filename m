These statements are not "missing" unless you presume that code written 
before the latest de facto language spec was written should somehow be 
held to that spec.

If the 'fallthrough' statement is not part of the latest draft spec then 
we should ask why not before we embrace it. Being that the kernel still 
prefers -std=gnu89 you might want to consider what has prevented 
-std=gnu99 or -std=gnu2x etc.

Seems to me you should be patching the compiler.

When you have consensus among the language lawyers you'll have more 
credibility with those being subjected to enforcement.
