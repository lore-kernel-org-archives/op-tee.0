This looks like an interesting feature. But I am not sure about the
real benefits that it will provide in case of trusted keys. If we are
looking at it performance wise then I think the gain will be
negligible when compared with slow TPM communication interface (eg.
SPI, I2C) or when compared with context switching involved in TEE.

Also, it requires arch specific support too which currently seems to
be limited to x86 only.

Current implementation only builds a single trusted.ko module. There
isn't any trusted_tpm.ko.
